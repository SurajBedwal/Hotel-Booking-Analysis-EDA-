# Hotel-Booking-Analysis-EDA-
This project involves a comprehensive examination of a dataset detailing hotel reservations spanning from 2015 to 2017 for both urban and resort hotels. The dataset includes various booking details for both types of hotels, such as the booking date, duration of stay, the number of adults, children, and infants, and the availability of parking spaces, among other details. All personally identifiable information has been removed from the data. I have conducted an exploratory data analysis using Python to extract insights from this dataset.
